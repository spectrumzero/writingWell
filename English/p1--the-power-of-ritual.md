When I came across the word "ritual" the first time, I mistook it as the word "routine". But after I checked the dictionary and figure out what it actually means, I found the relationship between "riual"  and "rountine" is very close. I agree that the rituals add structure to our lives, according to the author of this prompt book. And i want to supplement that the reason why the ritual has such a magic power lies right in its "routine" character. People can not only remember those emergent things as events, or even breaking revolutions in their lives, but also they know what will happen the next day in their sub consciousness. Compared to the "revolution", the latter is a more common experience in human's life world. 

We live in a world which is stuctured largely by our own habits. Habits of eating, sleeping, talking, excercising, listening, working, learning and so on, constitute the way we perceive our living status. To some extent, every habit is a kind of ritual. It doesnt mean that you have any explicit mysterious ceremony before you go to sleep, of course you can have one, it just means you have a sleeping "pattern" in your mind, even if you did not write it down. With this implicit pattern, you always know the most suitable time to sleep, the most comfortable gesture to be on the bed, the favorite song to listen when you have insomnia. Just like the physic process of stripping your clothes and wearing pajamas on, you also go through a mental process of changing your mind into an easy mood when you are prepared to sleep. What if you go straight home in a day which is not so busy and go to bed immediately, not taking shower, not replacing clothes, no toothtaking, no clean bed sheet? I think most of us will suffer from insomnia. Insomnia is the punishment of you not obeying your routine, the result of break of the routine. Very similar to the sanction to the sinner who disrupts the ritual, isnt it?

I would like to talk more about my studying rituals during the daytime rather than sleeping rituals--of course i have some. 

I assign many tasks for myself every day so i have to get up early to find a comfortable place for me to study for a long time. I set about 5 alarming clocks to make sure i can arrive at library before 8:00. According to my experiences, if i get there 8:30 latter, there wont be a desk right next to the window, allowing me to watch the natural landscape outside. It is not nonsense for me, because i hate the feelings of studying in a sealed place which make me feel nothing is flowing, including my thoughts.

Of course there still have some times that i get up late after 7:40 so i dont have time eating breakfast before i ride my bike to the library, even though the distance is very close. In this situation, i would enter the library and occupy the seats for my girlfriend and me first, put my book bag on the chair,  leave the library for about 20 minitues, and go to the cantenn to have a simple breakfast. By the way, fried wough and wonton are my favorites in the recent two months.

Back to the library, i start my studying of this day. There are three parts i will work in: the language part in the morning, the coding part in the afternoon, and the sociology part in the night. I will memorize and review the lexical words and grammatic knowledge of Japannese for less than 1.5 hours. At about 9:30, I will become a translator, translating some diagloses or essays on the textbook into Japannese. I believe it will improve my Japanese level heavily because this progress is erging me to think how to use a language practically instead of just memorizing the information. After 11:00, if i still have some time, i would do some english writing practices. It is chilling. I know it is a digression but i still want to mention here that English, also as a foreign language for me, is much easier to type than Japannese. lol.

At 12:00 or so, i will go with my girlfriend to have lunch. Then i usually go back to the department to have a break or i will have a regular headache in the afternoon. In normal, I come back to study before 2:30. Once arriviing the place, i will immediately start coding or learning things about coding. Now i am doing a javascript project and reading the source code those pros provides. I want to be a pro, too. It has taken me a long time to learn the fundamental or non-fundamental syntaxes of various language, but finally i figured out that only if i try to build a actual project in the real world, can i call myself "on the road". I spend about 3 hours on the projects during the afternoon. In theory, i should also spend one hour on the leetcode problem solving, but it seemed that i didnt have enough time these days. I will catch up latter.

After dinner, there is no much time remaining for me to study. To be honest, i often feel tired at this time. But i would still push me to do something concerning sociology. It is not just for the asks of getting a degree, but also for my thoughts, expressions, and experiences. I will use the remained 3 hours to read some literatures or write something. It would be happy if i am writing thinigs i truly believe in, but it would be a torture if i am only writing to meet the commands of several trash courses. Unfortnately, the latter happened several times. Also i wish my doctor dont push or ask me too much and i want him know his concerns is unnecessary. I would finish an excellent dissertation at the end, for myself.

This is how a day of mine goes on. It is a routine, and a ritual. I can feel the power this sounds-boring ritual gives to me. Because i can really feel i am getting stronger every day, if i obey the ritual. But if i just lay on the bed, browsing the short video like a zombie, doing and thinking nothing at all, i will lose this magic and get pulished. This is the power of ritual. The consistancy makes it. I make it.
